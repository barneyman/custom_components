my custom components for Home Assistant

## barneyman
Handles some switches and sensors I have running on Sonoffs and wemos d1s - my attempt at esphome

## bjfheadcount
A sensor that counts the number of devices tracked that are here - I belive this is redundant now, there is an internal sensor, but hey, it aint broke!

## luxlights
Sets scenes (turns my lights on/off, mostly) according to lux sensors and presence

## sunload
A sensor that acts as a trigger for automations I have that open/close blinds on a hot day
